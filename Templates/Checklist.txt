1. Clear global variables between test cases
2. Make sure variable names are unique
3. Don't use i when you're supposed to use j in for loops
4. Return early for "NO" outputs
5. Follow output specifications (sometimes "YES" or "Yes")
6. Finish getting all the inputs in loops
7. Watch for overflows with long long and be careful casting ll to int 
8. Array out of bounds (make array slightly bigger than max)
